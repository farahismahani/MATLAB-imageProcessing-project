MATLAB Image Processing & Deep Learning Project
A MATLAB project covering image processing, object detection, and deep learning-based image enhancement. Developed as part of a group assignment.

Project Overview  
This project explores various image processing techniques, including histogram equalization, edge detection, and object detection using Hough Transform. It also integrates deep learning using a Context Aggregation Network (CAN) for image noise removal.  

The project is divided into three main parts:  
- Part A: Basic Image Processing (filters, histograms, edge detection)  
- Part B: Object Detection (circle detection using Hough Transform)  
- Part C: Deep Learning for Image Enhancement (CAN network for noise removal)  

An interactive MATLAB GUI is included for testing different image processing functions.  

Features  
i.   Load & Process Grayscale Images ‚Äì Image display, filtering, contrast adjustment  
ii.  Edge Detection ‚Äì Sobel, Canny, Prewitt, Roberts gradient operators  
iii. Histogram Equalization & Thresholding ‚Äì Enhancing image contrast  
iv.  Circle Detection ‚Äì Using Hough Transform to identify circular objects  
v.   Deep Learning for Image Noise Removal ‚Äì Applying CAN (Context Aggregation Network)  
vi.  Interactive MATLAB GUI ‚Äì Test image processing techniques in a user-friendly interface  

How to Run the Project  
 A. Clone the Repository  
```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MATLAB-ImageProcessing-Project.git
cd MATLAB-ImageProcessing-Project
```
 B. Open MATLAB & Run Scripts  
- Part A (Basic Processing):  
  ```matlab
  run('PartA_BasicProcessing/main.m')
  ```
- Part B (Circle Detection):  
  ```matlab
  run('PartB_CircleDetection/detectCircles.m')
  ```
- Part C (Deep Learning for Noise Removal):  
  ```matlab
  run('PartC_DeepLearning/runCAN.m')
  ```
- To test with different images, place them in the `TestImages/` folder.
